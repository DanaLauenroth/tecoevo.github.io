| Speaker     | Title |	 Abstract |
| ----------- | ----------- |  ----------- |
| Ali Wajid | More accurate estimation of the basic reproductive ratio from epidemic incidence data using a model conditioned on major outbreaks | The basic reproductive number, R0, is a well-known quantifier of the rate of spread of an epidemic. Here we show that some methods for estimating this quantity from epidemic incidence data can lead to an over-estimation of this quantity. In particular, when fitting deterministic models to estimate the rate of spread, we do not account for the stochastic nature of epidemics and the fact that, given the same system, some outbreaks may lead to major epidemics and some may not. Necessarily, an observed epidemic that we wish to control is a major outbreak and this amounts to an implicit conditioning for major outbreaks which leads to the issue just described. In this talk, I will present a conditioned deterministic model as a solution to this problem. |
| Broom Mark  |   Evolution and games on graphs   | In this talk we will consider the evolutionary modelling of finite populations with a population structure represented by a graph. We start with evolution of an unstructured finite population with fixed fitnesses, then consider the same case where fitnesses depend upon game theoretical interactions. We develop these models, both fixed fitness and game theory based, to consider structured populations. We finish by considering the evolution of cooperation in such a case. In each case we consider the fixation probability, the probability of  a single mutant to replace the existing resident population, and also consider fixation times |
| Broom Mark  |    Evolutionary models of animal groups   | In this talk we consider the concept of animals groups. We discuss what we mean by a group, and look at multi-level selection where selection can happen at group and individual levels. We move on to consider specific interactions within an animal group using game-theoretical models. How do animals divide resources such as food and mating rights within groups and how do dominant individuals prevent subordinates from challenging them or leaving? We consider several models related to this .We also look into how foraging groups watch out for predators. |
| Gokhale Chaitanya  |    Ecological evolutionary games   | Evolutionary game theory has been applied to various fields ranging from life’s origins to language’s evolution. Biologically, the theory might sometimes sound highly simplistic. Simplicity is, however, precisely the power of abstraction that evolutionary games offer us to understand the immense complexity of biology. Keeping games as simple as possible, we have extended themto includemultiple interactions. This simple extension allows us to include some of the overlooked complexities in Nature concerning the number of interacting partners. After presenting some general results of the extension, we will discuss the application of our theory to mutualisms and social dilemmas. Through Tribolium beetles, we will see if it even makes sense to wonder about social dilemmas. Switching to antagonism, including minor ecological dynamics, is already enough to challenge established notions of ecology, such as the Red Queen hypothesis in host-parasite coevolution. Finally, we include ecological dynamics in a classical model of social evolution to test if an existing dilemma-resolution method still holds. We report our findings in this domain and close the discussion with our efforts to understand the feedback between evolutionary games and ecological dynamics. |
| Mohamadichamgavi Javad | Replicator dynamics with strategy dependent time delays| We construct a microscopic model of the replicator dynamics with strategy dependent time delays. In such a model, new players are born from parents who interacted and received payoffs in the past. We considered small time delay approximation, showed that it has high accuracy and illustrated the effects on Snowdrift and Stag-Hunt games. We show that unlike in all previous models of evolutionary games with time delays, the presence of strategy dependent time delays changes the stationary point of the replicator dynamics.|
| Morison Christo | Using recurrence relations to distinguish healthy and tumorous growth |  Simple models of healthy tissue and tumorous growth may depict these as linear and exponential, respectively. Without time series data, however, quantities other than the cell population are required to determine which growth pattern is being followed in a single snapshot of the system: hopeful candidates include variant allele frequency distributions (found from population-level data) and single cell mutational burden distribution (from cell-level data). I will present analysis and accompanying stochastic simulations performed to understand these distributions, along with some open/current problems I am tackling. |
| Pires Diogo | Evolutionary Models of Finite and Structured Populations | Evolutionary game theory has proved to be a powerful tool in understanding the self-organisation of collective behaviour. Even though initial evolutionary models with frequency-dependent fitness assumed infinite populations, the interest in finite population models has grown to establish its own methods and show their particularities. Firstly, the size of a finite population has crucial effects on the stability of strategies and, more generally, on the way fixation processes occur. We perform a systematic analysis of $2\times2$ games in well-mixed populations, focusing on the fixation probabilities of single mutants as functions of population size. A diversity of fixation function shapes emerges under 12 out of the 24 possible games, showing different increasing regions for which we provide explanations. Secondly, finite population models have more flexibility to account for realistic features. We consider a framework initially proposed in 2012, under which interacting groups arise from encounters of individuals moving in a network, thus overcoming the challenges that multiplayer interactions pose in structured populations. We consider particular movement models and study some of their characteristics and interplaying effects with structure.|
| Sayyar Golsa | Epidemic patterns of emerging variants with dynamical social distancing | Motivated by the emergence of new variants during the COVID-19 pan- demic, we consider an epidemiological model of disease transmission dynamics, where novel strains appear by mutations of the virus. In the considered scenarios, disease prevalence in the population is modulated by social distancing. We study the various patterns that are generated under different assumptions of cross-immunity. If recovery from a given strain provides immunity against all previous strains, but not against more novel strains, then we observe a very regular sequential pattern of strain replacement where newer strains predominate over older strains. However, if protection upon recovery holds only against that particular strain and none of the others, we find much more complicated dynamics with potential recurrence of earlier strains, and co-circulation of various strains. We compare the observed patterns with genomic analysis we have seen during the COVID-19 pandemic.|
| Tjikundi Kausutua | Discovering insight from the close contacts data collected using wearable proximity sensors in developing world settings | Continuous prevalence and re-emergence of infectious diseases such as Tuberculosis (TB), Ebola, Measles, influenza etc. in low-middle income countries necessitate the need to have accurate mining and analysis of face-to-face contact patterns between individuals. Most importantly, contact patterns among individuals are essential in identifying the potential transmission routes of infectious illnesses, particularly respiratory pathogens. Recent technological advancements, particularly wearable sensors have paved the way to measure and quantify real-world person-to-person interactions in space and time in order to best inform epidemic models by estimating the epidemic risk and also provide insights into the design of the intervention and mitigation strategies for social protection. Even though these data are a sample of a sample they provide an accurate number of contacts and duration of the contacts. This is an advantage since the transmission doesn’t only depend on the number of contacts but also on the duration of the contact. Unlike surveys and contact diaries where the number and duration of the contacts are only approximate figures, hence the data collected with wearable sensors yield a better representation of face-to-face contact patterns. Here we present and analyse the data collected from the developing world setting using wearable sensors. We also highlight the limitations and challenges associated with these data.|
| Traulsen Arne | Evolutionary dynamics (with constant fitness) on small networks | Evolutionary dynamics can be strongly affected by spatial structure – even in the absence of game theoretical interactions. A popular way to model such spatial structure are networks, where each node represents an individual and offspring can be placed to other sites via the links. How does such a network affect the probability of a new mutation to take over the entire population? And how does it alter the time this process is expected to take? Of particular interest are structures that increase the probability that advantageous mutations take over. Such amplifiers are surprisingly abundant among all networks. However, they do not necessarily maximize the fitness under long term evolution. Applying these models to real populations typically requires that each node is a subpopulation – leading to a different class of models.|
