## Schedule for a talk in the group

Feel free to choose your favourite medium/style for presenting your work.
However for giving the talk:

- we meet at **1030** (hopefully in person) and also in zoom (link is in the calendar hybrid format)
- assume that the audience is totally unaware of your project so choose the topic carefully
- the timeframe is 30 mins so spilt the time according to your choice but do not overrun
- if interesting questions or answers emerge during the talk make sure to keep them short given the time frame, one can then get back to the person after the meeting: getting feedback, help and developing connections is definitely the point.
