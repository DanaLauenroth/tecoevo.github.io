## Who am I?

I was born and raised in the beautiful city of Lübeck in northern Germany. 
I graduated from the University of Lübeck with a Master of Science in Mathematics in Medicine and Life Sciences. During my bachelor and master studies I attended several courses in the fields of biomathematics and bioinformatics. My enthusiasm for modelling biological systems was reinforced when I joined an interdisciplinary project which aimed to arouse school students' interest in Stochastics and to deepen their understanding by modelling the emergence of antibiotic resistances. Population dynamics, especially in the light of evolution, are of particular interest to me.


## Research interests

I am working on eco-evolutionary dynamics in agricultural systems. 
Modern medicine and agriculture are typical examples of how humans influence ecological and evoltionary dynamics. 
As antibiotic resistance is a major threat to public health, the evolution of resistance to pesticides (fungicides, herbicides or insecticides) is a global challenge in agriculture. 
My work aims to analyse ecological and evolutionary forces driving population dynamics in agricultural systems, with particular attention on resistance evolution, and to examine the impact of humans' action  by means of mathematical models and simulations.
Currently I focus on the evolution of herbicide resistance in perennial weed.
