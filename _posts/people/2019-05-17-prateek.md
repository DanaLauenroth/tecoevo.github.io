## Who am I?

I grew up in a small town called Shivpuri in India and did an integrated BS-MS degree in Physics from IISER-Kolkata. IISER offered me opportunity to take various interdisciplinary subjects during the course work. I became especially interested in the subject of evolutionary dynamics taken by Dr. Supratim Sengupta. I was intrigued by the application of various mathematical techniques for understanding complex social and biological phenomenon happening all around us and how same mathematical principles may be employed for understanding evolution at different scales. In my PhD (at IISER-Kolkata), I analysed an evolutionary game theoretical model of harassment bribery as well as bacterial competition of antibiotic producer, sensitive and degrader cells in a spatial environment. Both of these research topics have been motivated by current societal issues. In my free time, I love to read, program, sketch and meditate.


## Research interests

My research currently focuses on understanding synthetic gene drive systems. Synthetic gene drive is a genetic engineering technology which biases the chance of inheritance of the desired gene in a population. Hence drive genes can increase in frequency even when they have fitness disadvantage. This technology has numerous potential advantages (human health, agriculture and threatened species conservation) but also comes with great risks and challenges (confinement, societal impact, ecological and health impact). The focus of my work is to assess the risks of synthetic gene-drive systems in terms of spread and resistance evolution using mathematical modelling and simulations.

## Anouncement

We are glad to announce that the [DrMxR (Drive Mixer)](https://pverma.shinyapps.io/DrMxR/)
 is avialable online now. It is a handy tool to explore the population level consequences of different drive systems. You may acess DrMxR from [here](https://pverma.shinyapps.io/DrMxR/)
